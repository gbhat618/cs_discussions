# Hashing
* Key
* Hash function
* Table

## Collission
Two keys compute to the same index

## open hashing
Data can be stored outside the array. Solves collission by using __seperate chaining__

## closed hashing
Data needs to be stored inside the array. Solves collission by using using technique __open addressing__ or __linear probing__.



## Example

hashFunction --> Key % 13 ==> index

51 -->

key = 51

index = 51 % 13
      = 12
